Welcome to MazeSolver v.1.0 by Atkins Meyer and Carl Leth

Requirements: Python
	      
Usage: Windows, MazeSolver.bat
       Linux, python demo.py

       The neural network included in the package works best with
       mazes around 20 by 20 and 200 to 300 steps. 
       
       This demonstration neural network was built before some code
       refinements and is outdated and preforms poorly. I will create
       a more refined default neural network when I get some extra time.
